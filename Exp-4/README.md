## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an extension of **Experiment 3 (Multi-Page React + React Router)**.  
In **Experiment 4**, advanced React concepts have been implemented:

- ✅ useContext (Global State Management)
- ✅ useReducer (Structured State Updates)
- ✅ useMemo (Performance Optimization)
- ✅ One New Page Demonstrating All Above Concepts
- ✅ Improved UI/UX with Modern Design
- ✅ Animated Hero Section with Glass Morphism
- ✅ Mobile Responsive Navbar with Hamburger Menu
- ✅ Route Page Transitions
